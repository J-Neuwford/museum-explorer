# MUSEUM EXPLORER

A top down rpg style museum explorer using the V&A Collections API. The goal of this app is to further my understanding of React and CSS, and to gain more experience with third-party API integration. 

## MVP 
 - User should be able to move a character and explore exhibits in a museum
 - user should be able to view a title, image and description of the exhibit when they interact with it
